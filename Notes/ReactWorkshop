React Workshop
React is a JavaScript library for interactivity

3 Big Ideas
1. JSX
2. Components
3. State

JSX
- In JS we can treat functions as variables
let double = (x) => {
    return x*2;
};

The idea of JSX is that we let html elements 
be values as well
i.e. let elt = <div>Hello!</div>;
- or we could even set elt to be a whole
unordered list, i.e. we can nest tags


Components
- different way of thinking about our website
- html is usually in a nested structure
- let's rethink html elements
- we recognize repetition and make it cleaner

State
- updating values in our HTML can be tedious
- we usually have to isolate the value so that 
we can reference it, then get the exact element,
and then actually update the webpagae
- React will remove our involvement in this

this.state = {score: 28};
<div>Score: {this.state.score}</div>
#now the HTML is actually dependent on the state
function updateScore() {
    this.setState(state =? ({
        score: state.score +1
        //when we change the state inside the
        react program, any element that you have
        tied to that state will update itself
    }));
}

- note that user inputs, i.e. an input field, are also state
